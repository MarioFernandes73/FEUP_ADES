# FEUP_ADES
Repository for the course "Análise de Dados e Engenharia de Software" (MESW0009) of the second semester of the first year of MESW in FEUP.

This course teaches students the basics of data science, with special focus on data mining and possible ways to deal with projects of this nature. After this course students should be able to:
  *  Use descriptive statistics to describe data
  *  Know how to describe different phases of a project of CRISP knowledge
  *  Know how to use and analyze the results of the main methods of classification interpretation and regression 
  *  Know how to interpret analyzing methods of clusters
  *  Know how to use and interpret methods of association rules
  *  Know how to evalue analyzation methods and data visualization. 
  
In this repository there is the practical assignment of this course in the lective year of 2018/2019. This project detailed information and results can be consulted on: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ades2018. It mainly consisted on analyzing a huge .csv file with 3 columns: ID, Length (L) and Array. The Array was a sequence of L random numbers and the main objective was to try and determine which of the 2 sorting algorithms (merge-sort or heap-sort) were the fastest in order to sort each specific sequence.

Specifically on this repository, a small example of the .csv are shown, as well as pictures of the models used on RapidMiner as well as python scripts used to prepare the data for the model.

  *  chunks folder contains examples of the raw files given, 1 for training the model, 1 for corresponding the best algorithm for the training examples and 1 file to apply the model.
  *  deliverable_examples folder contains 2 files with raw data from the model output and 1 file parsed to be delivered.
  *  models folder contains pictures of the some of the models used.
  *  scripts folder contains all scripts and notes used during the project.
  *  presentation folder contains the presentation/report delivered.
